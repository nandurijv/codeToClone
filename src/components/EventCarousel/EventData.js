      Your task will be to replicate the given images in your coding sandbox.
      
      There will be 2 questions in the first round, and you can only move on to the next after finishing the first.
      
      Neither question are choice based and both carry weightage in the final assessment of the participant's performance.
      
      The duration of this round will be about 60 minutes. 
      
      Upon conclusion your auto submitted code will be sent to the judges for evaluation, and the results for Round 1 will be shortly announced.`

      The qualified coders of Round 1 will compete here.
      
      Unlike the first round, only one image will be displayed and that will be the common evaluation for all, albeit a little more challenging than before.
      
      The duration of this round will also be about 60 minutes and the code will be auto submitted at the end.
      
      The participants will be informed of the qualifiers of the last round shortly after completion.`

      The final round will be a showdown between the cream of the crop!
      
      You will get only one image to replicate, similar as round 2, but expect it to be the toughest obstacle yet.
      
      The duration of this round will be close to an hour, and upon its completion you will receive your certificates.
      
      The submissions will be thoroughly evaluated and the results will be announced on IEEE-SSIT's official instagram page the following day.`
